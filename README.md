## Project Proposal
In the face of increasing climate instability, the world must continually seek alternatives to mitigate these challenges. News frequently highlights the many facets of a planet in flux, emphasizing the urgent need for solutions to preserve the environment and ensure a sustainable future.

One key strategy is reducing pollution generated by energy production—an essential resource for modern society. With human reliance on electronic devices, medical equipment, factories, and other industrial resources, the demand for reliable energy sources is growing. In this context, renewable energy emerges as a promising solution.

Renewable energy sources are clean and harness inexhaustible natural resources such as solar radiation, wind, and water movement. A particularly efficient application of this technology is microgrids.

### What Are Microgrids?
Microgrids are compact, localized systems designed to generate sustainable energy for specific areas. Unlike large power plants that supply entire cities, microgrids focus on smaller communities or facilities.

These systems are highly flexible, capable of combining different renewable energy sources. When necessary, they activate non-renewable sources temporarily to ensure an uninterrupted energy supply. Once renewable resources are available again, non-renewable sources are automatically deactivated.

Additionally, microgrids require suitable spaces that meet their operational demands for energy, connectivity, and infrastructure. This makes reliable partners essential for successful implementation.

## How Does GridHub Work?

The platform is organized into five main sections, accessible via the navigation bar:

1. **Investment Campaigns**
2. **Rentable Spaces**
3. **My Spaces**
4. **My Microgrids**
5. **User Profile**

---

### Rentable Spaces

In the **Rentable Spaces** section, users can browse all spaces listed on the platform by other users for microgrid installations. Each space includes detailed information, such as:

- Full location (address).
- Photos of the space.
- Compatible energy sources.
- Landlord contact information (email and phone).

Interested users can contact the landlord directly to negotiate an agreement outside the platform. Once an agreement is reached, the microgrid can be registered on the platform and linked to the selected space.

**Space Registration**  
Property owners can list their spaces by providing:

- Location.
- Energy source compatibility.
- Photos.
- Conditions of the space.

After registration, the space becomes visible to all platform users.  

The platform also manages available capacity, updating the remaining area automatically as microgrids are allocated. Once the available space is fully occupied, the listing is removed from the **Rentable Spaces** section.

---

### Microgrid Registration and Management

Microgrid owners use the platform to register their installations and link them to a previously negotiated space. Registered microgrids include:

- Energy sources used.
- Specific operational needs.
- Funding goals (for potential investors).
- Photos and descriptions.
- Location (linked to a registered space).

Once registered, microgrids appear in two sections:

1. **Allocated Microgrids** under the corresponding space.
2. **Investment Campaigns**, where they are available for financial support from potential investors.

Detailed microgrid information is publicly accessible, including:

- Location.
- Performance reports (e.g., solar panel temperatures, energy generated, and profits from energy credits).

Microgrid owners manage their installations in the **My Microgrids** section, where they can edit or delete listings as needed.

---

### Investment Campaigns

The **Investment Campaigns** section lists all microgrids registered on the platform. Clicking on a specific microgrid provides detailed information, including its funding goal.

Users interested in investing can select the **Become an Investor** option, which follows these steps:

1. The investor views the details of a microgrid and clicks **Become an Investor**.
2. A pop-up window called **Investment Proposal** allows the investor to draft and submit an offer.
3. The platform automatically sends the proposal via email to the microgrid owner.

## Conclusion

**GridHub** emerges as a vital solution at a critical moment for our planet's future. By connecting space landlords, microgrid owners, and committed investors, the platform not only facilitates the implementation of renewable energy sources but also fosters a collaborative network that drives sustainability and technological innovation.

With its integrated and functional approach, GridHub positions itself as a catalyst for the proliferation of clean energy, directly contributing to reduced carbon emissions and the creation of a more resilient and balanced world.  

GridHub is more than just a platform—it’s a concrete step toward a sustainable future.
